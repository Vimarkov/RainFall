We can see in this binary that it fopen "/home/user/level8/.pass"
We can see also the fgets function that store the read file desciptor and store his content into a c string.
There is a non call function m that print the c string and time.
The binary need two arguments. Both off them are moved in the heap with strcpy.
Program segfault when the first argument is too long. We can see that we can overwrite the destination adress of the second strcpy.
We replace it with the got address of puts and in the second argument we choose what to write in this address so the m function.

$> ./level7 `python -c "print 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x28\x99\x04\x04'"` `python -c "print '\xf4\x84\x04\x08'"`
