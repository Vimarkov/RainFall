The programm launch "/bin/sh" if the input match with fread buffer of /home/user/end/.pass
The programm also atoi our input to specify at wich lenght it should insert a null character.
So if we put 0 as input we can make the string read in /home/user/end/.pass be null.
But it compare null with 0 si the strcmp doesn't match. The programm exit
if there is more or less than two args.
We put "" as arg and we have the shell.

$> ./bonus3 ""
