The program call gets that is vulnerable to segfault. We can overwrite the eip but the program make
a cmp so that if our eip start by 0xb it call the exit function. A way to bypass this is to redirect the stream
to the forward ret function wich start with 0x080.
We can now use the ret2libc method to redirect the flow to "system /bin/sh" execution
